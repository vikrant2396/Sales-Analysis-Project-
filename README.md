# Sales-Analysis-Project-
The Sales Analysis project focuses on analyzing historical sales data to uncover meaningful insights that help businesses improve revenue, understand customer behavior, and optimize decision-making. The project involves cleaning and preprocessing raw sales data, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, patterns, and seasonal effects in sales performance.

Key metrics such as total revenue, sales growth, profit margins, top-selling products, and regional performance are analyzed using data visualization techniques. Customer segmentation is performed to understand purchasing behavior across different demographics and locations. The project also evaluates sales performance over time to identify peak periods and underperforming areas.

Advanced analysis includes forecasting future sales using statistical or machine learning models, enabling better inventory planning and demand prediction. The final results are presented through interactive dashboards and visual reports, providing actionable insights for business stakeholders to drive strategic planning and improve overall sales efficiency.
